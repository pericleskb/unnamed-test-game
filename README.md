# unnamed-test-game
This is a game I am making in C++, using the SFML library.
I started making this game for educative and entertainment purposes.

All the art I am using is offered by its creators for free usage by anyone.
I am using the pugixml parser, for reading the map data and the data to extract sprites from spritesheets.
Also the AnimatedSprite and Animation files were taken from the SFML wiki at Github and weren't created by me.
